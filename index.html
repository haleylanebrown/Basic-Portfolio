		<p id="paragraph1"> 
			Haley currently lives in Denver, CO. She attended Grove City College and received a B.S. in Molecular Biology in 2012 with a double minor in Psychology and English. She then attended the University of Colorado Denver's Child Health Associate/Physician Assistant Program and received a M.S. in Physician-Assistant Studies in 2016. She has a bourgeoning interest in practicing clinical psychology, with an emphasis on trauma and attachment. She attended the Denver University Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp in the spring of 2019 and grew her passion for creative coding. Haley jokes that she is a "collector of careers" and is equally passionate about them all.

			Haley volunteers with a refugee youth leadership program in Denver and leads a church small group with her husband. When she's not working or volunteering, Haley enjoys traveling, painting, skiing, and singing with her church worship team.
